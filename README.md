Configuring the WM8731 control interface via I2C/MPU:
Develop (or use an existing) I2C/MPU module to send a configuration command sequence to the WM8731.
Program the necessary commands: select the digital communication format (e.g., I2S, DSP mode), set the sample rate, data length, volume, mute, etc.
The advantage of this step is that after configuration is complete, the codec will be ready to receive digital data according to the desired standard (refer to timing and configuration in the documentation).
